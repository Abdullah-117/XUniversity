<p class="aboutus">
    The original Latin word universitas refers in general to "a number of persons associated into one body, a society, company, 
    community, guild, corporation, etc".[7] At the time of the emergence of urban town life and medieval guilds, specialized 
    "associations of students and teachers with collective legal rights usually guaranteed by charters issued by princes, prelates, 
    or the towns in which they were located" came to be denominated by this general term. Like other guilds, they were self-regulating and 
    determined the qualifications of their members.[8]
    In modern usage the word has come to mean "An institution of higher education offering tuition in mainly non-vocational subjects 
    and typically having the power to confer degrees,"[9] with the earlier emphasis on its corporate organization considered as applying 
    historically to Medieval universities.[10]
    The original Latin word referred to degree-awarding institutions of learning in Western and Central Europe, where this form of legal 
    organisation was prevalent and from where the institution spread around the world.
    Academic freedom
    An important idea in the definition of a university is the notion of academic freedom. The first documentary evidence of this 
    comes from early in the life of the University of Bologna, which adopted an academic charter, the Constitutio Habita,[11] 
    in 1158 or 1155,[12] which guaranteed the right of a traveling scholar to unhindered passage in the interests of education. 
    Today this is claimed as the origin of "academic freedom".[13] This is now widely recognised internationally - on 18 September 
    1988, 430 university rectors signed the Magna Charta Universitatum,[14] marking the 900th anniversary of Bologna's foundation. 
    The number of universities signing the Magna Charta Universitatum continues to grow, drawing from all parts of the world.
    Antecedents Scholars occasionally call the University of al-Qarawiyyin (name given in 1963), founded as a mosque by Fatima al-Fihri 
    in 859, a university,[16][17][18][19] although Jacques Verger writes that this is done out of scholarly convenience.[20] Several 
    scholars consider that al-Qarawiyyin was founded[21][22] and run[15][23][24][25][26] as a madrasa until after World War II. They date 
    the transformation of the madrasa of al-Qarawiyyin into a university to its modern reorganization in 1963.[27][28][15] In the wake 
    of these reforms, al-Qarawiyyin was officially renamed "University of Al Quaraouiyine" two years later.[27]
    Some scholars argue that Al-Azhar University, founded in 970-972 AD and located in Cairo, Egypt, is the oldest degree-
    granting university in the world and the second oldest university in the world.[29]
    Some scholars, including George Makdisi, have argued that early medieval universities were influenced by the madrasas in Al-Andalus, 
    the Emirate of Sicily, and the Middle East during the Crusades.[30][31][32] Norman Daniel, however, views this argument as overstated
    .[33] Roy Lowe and Yoshihito Yasuhara have recently drawn on the well-documented influences of scholarship from the Islamic world on 
    the universities of Western Europe to call for a reconsideration of the development of higher education, turning away from a concern 
    with local institutional structures to a broader consideration within a global context.[34]
    Medieval Europe
    Main articles: Medieval university and List of medieval universities
    The modern university is generally regarded as a formal institution that has its origin in the Medieval Christian tradition.[35][36]
    European higher education took place for hundreds of years in cathedral schools or monastic schools (scholae monasticae), in which 
    monks and nuns taught classes; evidence of these immediate forerunners of the later university at many places dates back to the 
    6th century.[37]
    In Europe, young men proceeded to university when they had completed their study of the trivium–the preparatory arts of grammar, 
    rhetoric and dialectic or logic–and the quadrivium: arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy.
    The earliest universities were developed under the aegis of the Latin Church by papal bull as studia generalia and perhaps from 
    cathedral schools. It is possible, however, that the development of cathedral schools into universities was quite rare, with 
    the University of Paris being an exception.[38] Later they were also founded by Kings (University of Naples Federico II, Charles 
    University in Prague, Jagiellonian University in Kraków) or municipal administrations (University of Cologne, University of Erfurt). 
    In the early medieval period, most new universities were founded from pre-existing schools, usually when these schools were deemed 
    to have become primarily sites of higher education. Many historians state that universities and cathedral schools were a continuation 
    of the interest in learning promoted by The residence of a religious community.[39] Pope Gregory VII was critical in promoting and 
    regulating the concept of modern university as his 1079 Papal Decree ordered the regulated establishment of cathedral schools that 
    transformed themselves into the first European universities.[40]
